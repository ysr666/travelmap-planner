# Autonomous Iteration Phase Ledger

## 2026-06-17 Phase 1 - Trip Home Overview

Status: completed

Goal: make Trip Home feel like a real trip command center with a full-trip map overview, next-step orientation, and clearer entry points into day, ticket, route, ledger, and readiness workflows.

Scope:

- Improve `TripWorkspacePage` layout and derived overview model.
- Reuse existing local data, `TripMapPreview`, readiness, route preparation, tickets, and ledger entry points.
- Keep user-facing copy in Chinese.

No-go:

- No IndexedDB schema changes.
- No cloud sync, Supabase, provider proxy, route cache, AI privacy, or ticket blob contract changes.
- No real AI, search, route, map, Cloudflare, Supabase, or other provider calls.

Likely files:

- `src/pages/TripWorkspacePage.tsx`
- `src/pages/TripWorkspacePage.test.tsx`
- supporting UI components only if existing page patterns require it.

Validation:

- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test:unit -- src/pages/TripWorkspacePage.test.tsx`
- broader tests before final push.

Risk: medium, because Trip Home is a central route but the work is local UI and derived state only.

Stop conditions:

- Stop or narrow scope if the implementation requires protected data contracts, real provider calls, or schema changes.
- Stop and repair within phase if Trip Home tests or build fail due to this phase.

Result:

- Added a Trip Home command-center overview with trip stats, focus day, next item, map coverage, and quick entries for tickets, route preparation, and ledger.
- Reworked the focus-day timeline preview so it no longer labels the first item as in-progress without evidence.
- Kept the change local to UI and derived state; no schema, sync, route cache, provider, AI privacy, or cloud semantics changed.

Validation:

- `npm run test:unit -- src/pages/TripWorkspacePage.test.tsx` passed.
- `npm run lint -- src/pages/TripWorkspacePage.tsx src/pages/TripWorkspacePage.test.tsx` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
